Multi-Class Image Classification using Transfer Learning on Mobile Gallery Images in PyTorch

## Introduction
Using the images present in your mobile gallery to train an Image Classifier using Transfer-Learning ! :D

## STEP 1: Building a Custom Dataset

Dataset that I have used is https://www.kaggle.com/n0obcoder/mobile-gallery-image-classification-data 
It has 6 classes -
* Cars
* Memes
* Mountains
* Selfies
* Trees
* Whataspp_Screenshots

A few of the sample images form the training set are shown below

## STEP 2: Data Pre-Processing and Making DataLoaders

## STEP 3: Defining a Suitable Model and Making the Necessary Tweaks

## STEP 4: Transfer Learning by Freezing and Un-Freezing the Layers

## STEP 5: Loss Function and Optimizer

## STEP 6: Training and Validation

## STEP 7: It's Testing Time !
